# Overview

This is an web app made with React based on design and user stories of the [Country Quiz challenge from devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8). The country list used to generate the questions is being fetched from [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/).

When the quiz starts, a question will appear, the question can either ask for you to pick the country to which the flag being displayed belongs to or the country to which the capital being displayed belongs to.

After selecting and submitting yout answer, the results for that question will appear and you can move to the next view by clicking next.

If you answer the question correctly, the quiz continues, but if you answer it incorrectly the quiz ends, shows you your results for the whole quiz and offers you the opportunity to try again.
